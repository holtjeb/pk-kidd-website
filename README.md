# pk-kidd-website
Our Coding I website project

We have been working alongside P.K. Kidd to make a website. Much of the information on the site was given to us by them directly. We had to ask for a picture consent form to be sent out, and they also helped out with that so then we can add videos and photos. This was a constant collaboration effort between us and them, and they plan to use this as their official website whenever we are complete with this. We plan to update this website on a regular basis even after the project part is complete. There are photos that were not used, but we plan to use those to show what the building looks like at some point.
